# Concept
- React is a JavaScript library for building user interfaces
- All about components. All user interfaces in the end are made up of components
    - combine HTML, CSS and JavaScript in components
    - combine components together to build user interface. 
- nodejs
    - It isn't directly related to React. It's not the end a runtime for JavaScript which would allow you to run JavaScript code outside of the browser. 
    - Use node.js for development preview server
