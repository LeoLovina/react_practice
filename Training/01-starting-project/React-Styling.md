# Styling 
- conditional inline style. 
    - example: set a style value dynamically. ```  <label style={{ color: isVaild ? '' : 'red' }}>Course Goal</label> ```
- change class dynamically (template literal)
    - CSS
    ``` CSS
    .form-control.invalid input {
    border-color: red;
    background: #fad0ec;
    }
    ```
    - JS
    ``` javascript
    <div className={`form-control ${isValid? '': 'invalid'}`}>
        <input type="text" onChange={goalInputChangeHandler} />
    </div>
    ```
# styled component
https://styled-components.com/
- It dynamically generated by the styled components package for the component.Because what this package does in the end is it looks at the styles we set up here and then it wraps these styles into generated class names where it guarantees that every class name is unique so that it can spill over to other components of the app. And it will then add these classes as global CSS. But now since we have unique class names for every styled component, the style set up here will never be able to affect the number of component in the app.
